print() = computer states what in ()

VARIABLE
Message_string = store of info e.g. "hello world!"
# so now we can use that message string in other code e.g. print(message_string)
# message_string can be anythign e.g. meal = "lunch" (message_string is meal)
Meal = store of info e.g. "hellow world!"

# Syntax error - written wrong code
# Name error - does not recognise word e.g. printe("")

int = integer  e.g. 2
float = decimal point  e.g. 2.5

an_int = 2
a_float = 2.5
print(an_int + 2) - with int/float, no quotation marks needed 

# ** = to the power of (indicies) e.g. 2 ** 10 = 2 to the power of 10

# % gives only the remainder of the calculation e.g. 5 / 2 = 2.5 but 5 % 2 = 5 cause 5 is the remainder

# strings can be added e.g. full_text = first_text + second_text 
# If want to add a number to added strings, str(), e.g. 
string1 = str(2)
string2 = " I am"
message = string1 + string2
print(message) = 2 I am

# adding to a current set variable is done via += e.g.
miles = 2
miles += 2
print(miles) = 4
# if the value being added to miles is a separate varialbe you can replace the number with it e.g.
miles += kilometers 

# when code goes across 2 or more lines, """ triple are used to signal that until another """, it should not stop reading the code e.g.
"""hello world my name is ... and I am  up to
many things including"""

for user input, we use input() e.g.
likes_snakes = input("do you like snakes?")

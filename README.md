## Step 1: Learn Core Libraries  
### What to do:  
- Follow tutorials or courses focused on each library:  
  - **NumPy:** Arrays, linear algebra, mathematical operations  
  - **Matplotlib:** Data visualization and plotting  
  - **Pandas:** Data handling and manipulation  
  - **SciPy:** Scientific computing, optimization, integration  

### Resources:  
- [Official NumPy Tutorial](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)  
- [Matplotlib Tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)  
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html)  
- [SciPy Lecture Notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/)  

### How to show progress:  
- Create small Jupyter notebooks demonstrating each library’s core functions.  
- Upload these notebooks to GitHub in a folder named `/PythonBasics`.  
- Write brief README explanations for each notebook to show understanding.

## Step 2: Learn Jupyter Notebooks  
### What to do:  
- Install Jupyter and learn to create, run, and document notebooks.  
- Practice combining code, text, and visuals for clear communication.  

### Resources:  
- [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.org/documentation)  
- [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/)  

### How to show progress:  
- Convert your learning notebooks from Step 1 into well-documented, shareable Jupyter notebooks.  
- Use markdown cells to explain your code and findings clearly.  
- Publish notebooks on GitHub with a clear structure.

## Step 3: Complete a Materials Science Project  
### Project ideas:  
- Simulate diffusion of atoms in a polymer or metal using NumPy/SciPy.  
- Plot stress-strain curves from sample data using Matplotlib.  
- Analyze experimental data sets with Pandas to find trends or anomalies.

### How to approach:  
- Define a clear, focused research question related to your self-healing polymer project.  
- Write code to simulate or analyze the phenomenon.  
- Visualize results clearly with plots and diagrams in a Jupyter notebook.  

### How to show progress:  
- Upload your complete project notebook and any related code/data files to a `/MaterialsScienceProject` folder in GitHub.  
- Write a **project summary** in the README highlighting your objectives, approach, and results.  
- Link this project on your LinkedIn or CV under a “Relevant Projects” or “Technical Skills” section.
